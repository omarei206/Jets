### OOP - Jets Application

## Overview
This is a dynamic Object-Oriented program that I have created to solidify my knowledge of Abstraction and Inheritance of classes. The program first starts by launching a menu that gives the user multiple options on how to interact with a fleet of jets that were read in from a text file. The user has different options on viewing information about the jets in the fleet, and they are able to add their own jets to the fleet, or remove jets from the fleet.

## Technologies Used
-Eclipse
-Java
-Github
-Git
-Terminal
-Google
-UML


## Lessons Learned
-I learned that with multiple classes it is very useful to use comments so it is easy to come back and fix code.
-I learned about and implemented the ability to read from files and convert the information in them.
-I learned that writing down what I intend to do in small miniature projects using UML diagrams helps a lot.

## What to improve on next time
The next time I have a project like this I could make the console output be more esthetically pleasing for the user interaction.
